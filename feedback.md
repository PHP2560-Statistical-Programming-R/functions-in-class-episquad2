Nice code! 
Some points can be improved:

a) Please add some comments to explain the key steps in your code.

b) For the function **gamma_jackknife**, it would be better to define **a_gamma and s_gamma** inside your function.

c) For the function **omit.case**, there is no need to use the condition **length(dim(the_data)) == 1**.

Good job!
